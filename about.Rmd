About this project

The purpose of this project is to model happiness around the world. By comparing various 
values to a country's happiness I hope to give the reader a deeper understadning of what 
drives happiness around the world. I hope to provide a novel realization about the state
of happiness in the world to my reader. I hope that I may allow my reader to question pre-
conceptions they held about happiness today. 

About the Data

I have compiled my data from several sources. The primary resource I have used thus far is the World
Population Review, a website that tracks data on various topics about each country. I also used data
from the World Bank to get data on urbanization. The most important part of my data(happiness scores),
is compiled by the World Happiness Report.
